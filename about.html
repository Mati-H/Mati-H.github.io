                Answering this question was my primary goal when creating this online art gallery. I wanted to memorialize the lives and artworks of the men and women who experienced the Holocaust firsthand. Their depictions of horrific events, as well as their self-portraits,
                not only give insight into their lives during WWII but also the human condition. I wanted these pieces to make a real impression on their observer, to evoke empathy that artwork cannot ordinarily elicit. I wanted to remind viewers that
                each victim of the Holocaust was not a number&mdash;not 1 out of 6 million&mdash;but an individual person with an individual list of sufferings. Many of the showcased artists painted themselves to this effect.

                The greater picture of the Holocaust and WWII&mdash;one that we try to acknowledge with our study of history&mdash;often feels medicinal and falls short of addressing the importance of the <span class="bold">individuals</span> who suffered
                unimaginable hardships at the time and most often lost their lives. I was unsatisfied with the overly general perspective which I was given and the figures that came with it: <span class="light">6 million</span>, <span class="light">80 million</span>,
                <span class="light">24 million</span>. As such, I found it necessary for myself to develop a more personal understanding of these events. I knew that it was impossible for me to commemorate each life lost or fully understand the hardships
                which each person faced, so I decided instead to explore the lives and stories of various artists who lived at the time, many of whom died due to the events of the Holocaust. This gave me the opportunity to interpret their intentions and
                experience the different emotions felt by the people whose lives had been cut short.
